# 💥 Stress Buster

A fun, browser-based stress relief tool. Load any image, then smash it with a hammer or shoot it with a gun. No sign-up, no server — everything stays on your device.

## How It Works

1. **Load an image** — drag & drop, tap to upload, or use your camera
2. **Pick a weapon** — Hammer 🔨 or Gun 🔫
3. **Smash away!** — click/tap to destroy the image and release some stress

## Features

- 🔨 **Hammer** — leaves realistic crack patterns on impact
- 🔫 **Gun** — shoots bullet holes with fire effects and sound
- 📸 **Camera capture** — snap a photo directly from your webcam
- 📱 **Mobile support** — touch events, floating toolbar, haptic feedback
- 🔒 **Privacy first** — images are never uploaded to any server

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [WebcamJS](https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs) for camera capture
- No frameworks, no build step — just open `index.html`
